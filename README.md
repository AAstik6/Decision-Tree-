# 🌳 Decision Tree - Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates how the **Decision Tree** algorithm works for classification tasks using a supervised learning approach. It's implemented using Python with libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.

## 📌 What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like tree structure where:
- Each **internal node** represents a test on a feature.
- Each **leaf node** represents a class label (decision).
- The paths from the root to leaf represent decision rules.

It splits the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features and builds the tree recursively.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Select the Best Feature**: 
   The algorithm chooses the feature that best separates the data (based on metrics like **Gini Impurity**, **Entropy**, or **Information Gain**).

2. **Split the Dataset**: 
   Based on the selected feature, the dataset is split into subsets.

3. **Repeat Recursively**: 
   For each subset, repeat the process to grow the tree.

4. **Stopping Conditions**: 
   The recursion stops when:
   - All instances belong to one class.
   - A predefined depth is reached.
   - No further improvement is possible.
